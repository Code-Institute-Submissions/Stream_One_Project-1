# Stream One Project

Repository for my Stream One Project

## Introduction

For the basis of this project, I wanted to do something that is worthwhile and that may be of help to someone in some way.  So I decided to choose a local charity that helps homeless people and redesign their website.  The main reason being that I think it could be slightly more contemporary and it was also created using responsive design (screen does not always fir teh viewpoint of the device it is being used on):
