# Stream One Project

Repository for my Stream One Project.  Project can be view <a href="https://jagger81.github.io/Stream_One_Project/" target="_blank" >here</a>

## Introduction

For the basis of this project, I wanted to do something that is worthwhile and that may be of help to someone in some way.  So I decided to choose a local charity that helps homeless people and redesign their website.  The main reason being that I think it could be slightly more contemporary and it was also created using non-responsive design (screen does not always fit the viewpoint of the device it is being viewed on):

**Below Screenshots Show Unresponsive Menu And Text Not Readable To The Right Of The Screen**

## Proposed Solution

To create a more streamlined, repsonsive site that will be more attractive to look at and smoother to use (creating a better user experience) - this will be achieved by using the below-mentioned libraries and frameworks.

The site is made up of the following pages:

- Home
- About
- Services
    - Overview
    - Prevention Services
    - Housing Services
    - Homeless Services
    - Drug Treatment Services
- Get Involved
    - Fundraising
    - Volunteering
- Donate

Below are some screenshots of the mockups for the main pages.
